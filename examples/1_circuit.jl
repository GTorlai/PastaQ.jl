# 1. Unitary quantum circuit
# Returns the MPS at the output of the quantum circuit:
# `|ψ⟩ = Û|0,0,…,0⟩`
# where `Û` is the unitary circuit.

# A representation of the unitary operation as a MPO
# is obtained using the flag `process=true`:

# 2. Quantum circuit with noise
# Apply a noide model `noise` (specified by appropriate 
# parameters) to each quantum gate in `gates`.
# Returns a mixed density operator as MPO:
# `ρ = ε(|0,0,…⟩⟨0,0,̇|)`
# where `ε` is the quantum channel.
# Here, the noise is a single-qubit amplitude damping 
# channel with decay rate `γ=0.01`..

# A representation of the quantum channel as a MPO

# returns the Choi matrix `Λ` of the channel:`:
